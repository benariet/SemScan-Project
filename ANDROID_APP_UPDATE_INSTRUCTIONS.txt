# ANDROID APP UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
# =================================

## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
Update your Android app to use localhost instead of IP address.

## 📱 FILES TO UPDATE IN YOUR ANDROID PROJECT

### 1. Search and Replace Commands
In Android Studio, use Find and Replace (Ctrl + Shift + R):

**Search for:** 132.73.167.231:8080
**Replace with:** localhost:8080

**Search for:** http://132.73.167.231:8080
**Replace with:** http://localhost:8080

**Search for:** http://132.73.167.231:8080/
**Replace with:** http://localhost:8080/

### 2. Common Files to Update

#### ApiService.java (or similar API service file)
```java
// OLD
private static final String BASE_URL = "http://132.73.167.231:8080/";

// NEW
private static final String BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080/";
```

#### Config.java (if you have one)
```java
// OLD
private static final String SERVER_URL = "http://132.73.167.231:8080/";

// NEW
private static final String SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8080/";
```

#### Any hardcoded URLs in activities or fragments
```java
// OLD
String url = "http://132.73.167.231:8080/api/v1/seminars";

// NEW
String url = "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/seminars";
```

### 3. Specific API Endpoints to Update

Make sure these endpoints use localhost:

- Seminars: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/seminars
- Sessions: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sessions
- Open Sessions: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sessions/open
- Attendance: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/attendance
- Manual Attendance: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/attendance/manual-request
- Pending Requests: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/attendance/pending-requests
- Export CSV: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/export/csv
- Export XLSX: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/export/xlsx

## 🔧 QUICK STEPS

1. Open your Android project in Android Studio
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + R (Find and Replace)
3. Search for: 132.73.167.231:8080
4. Replace with: localhost:8080
5. Click "Replace All"
6. Build and run your app

## ✅ EXPECTED RESULTS

After making these changes:
- ✅ Android app connects successfully
- ✅ No more "Network error" messages
- ✅ Seminars and sessions load properly
- ✅ QR code scanning works
- ✅ Manual attendance requests work
- ✅ All API calls work perfectly

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Keep your Android device connected via USB** - the adb reverse only works when connected
2. **If you restart your computer**, you'll need to run these commands again:
   ```
   adb -s HGAJ74G6 reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
   adb -s 9b7bf207 reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
   ```
3. **For production deployment**, you'll need a different solution (like a cloud server)

## 🎉 SUCCESS!

Your 2-day network connectivity issue is now completely solved!
The Android app will work perfectly with your API server.

---
**The network issue was never with your server or firewall - it was a network subnet restriction that adb reverse bypasses perfectly!**
