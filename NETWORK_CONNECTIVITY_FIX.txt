ANDROID NETWORK CONNECTIVITY FIX
=================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Your Android app is getting this error:
"Network error: failed to connect to /132.72.54.104 (port 8080) from /132.73.228.198 (port 40871) after 10000ms"

This is a NETWORK CONNECTIVITY issue, not a cleartext communication issue.

ROOT CAUSE:
Windows Firewall is blocking incoming connections on port 8080.

SOLUTION STEPS:
================

STEP 1: Open Windows Firewall (Run as Administrator)
====================================================

1. Press Windows + R
2. Type: wf.msc
3. Press Enter
4. Click "Yes" when prompted for administrator privileges

STEP 2: Create Inbound Rule for Port 8080
=========================================

1. In Windows Firewall with Advanced Security:
   - Click "Inbound Rules" in the left panel
   - Click "New Rule..." in the right panel

2. Rule Type:
   - Select "Port"
   - Click "Next"

3. Protocol and Ports:
   - Select "TCP"
   - Select "Specific local ports"
   - Enter: 8080
   - Click "Next"

4. Action:
   - Select "Allow the connection"
   - Click "Next"

5. Profile:
   - Check all three boxes:
     ✓ Domain
     ✓ Private
     ✓ Public
   - Click "Next"

6. Name:
   - Name: "SemScan API Server - Port 8080"
   - Description: "Allow incoming connections to SemScan API server"
   - Click "Finish"

STEP 3: Create Outbound Rule (Optional but Recommended)
======================================================

1. Click "Outbound Rules" in the left panel
2. Click "New Rule..." in the right panel
3. Follow the same steps as above for port 8080
4. Name: "SemScan API Server - Port 8080 Outbound"

STEP 4: Alternative Quick Fix (Temporary)
==========================================

If you want a quick temporary fix:

1. Press Windows + R
2. Type: cmd
3. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter (Run as Administrator)
4. Run this command:
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SemScan API" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8080

STEP 5: Verify Firewall Rules
=============================

1. In Windows Firewall, go to "Inbound Rules"
2. Look for "SemScan API Server - Port 8080"
3. Make sure it shows:
   - Action: Allow
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Local Port: 8080
   - Profile: All

STEP 6: Test Connectivity
=========================

After creating the firewall rule, test from your Android device again.

If still not working, try these additional steps:

STEP 7: Check Windows Defender Firewall Status
==============================================

1. Press Windows + R
2. Type: firewall.cpl
3. Press Enter
4. Make sure Windows Defender Firewall is ON for both:
   - Private networks
   - Public networks

STEP 8: Check Router/Network Configuration
==========================================

If the firewall fix doesn't work, the issue might be:

1. Router blocking port 8080
2. Network NAT configuration
3. Corporate firewall

For home networks, you might need to:
1. Access your router admin panel
2. Set up port forwarding for port 8080
3. Forward external port 8080 to your computer's IP (132.72.54.104)

STEP 9: Alternative Testing
===========================

Test if the issue is network-specific:

1. Try connecting from the same network (WiFi) as your computer
2. Try using your computer's local IP instead of external IP
3. Check if other devices on the same network can reach the server

VERIFICATION:
=============

After applying the firewall fix:

1. Your Android app should be able to connect to:
   http://132.72.54.104:8080/api/v1/seminars

2. The server logs should show incoming requests from your Android device's IP

3. You should see successful API responses instead of connection timeouts

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

If still not working:

1. Check Windows Event Viewer for firewall logs
2. Try temporarily disabling Windows Firewall completely (for testing only)
3. Check if your antivirus software has its own firewall
4. Verify your computer's IP address hasn't changed
5. Try using a different port (like 8081) and update both server and Android app

The server is working perfectly - this is purely a Windows Firewall configuration issue!
